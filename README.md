# Executive-Financial-dashboard
I have created a report using power bi that contains an executive summary of financial data with interactive charts and filters. It visualizes key metrics and helps gain insights into trends, regional performance, and sales segmentation. Analysed by month, year, country, and product segment, it facilitates data-driven decisions and strategic planning.
